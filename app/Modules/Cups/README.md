Cups
===

- Single-Elimination
- The maximum of participants per cup is 1024 (let us know if this value does not meet your requirements)
- 1on1 and team matches are possible
- Wildcards: There will never be wildcard-matches in other rounds than the first one.
- To join a team cup, a team needs enough players
- Teams are locked while they participate in a cup. No one can leave or join them.
- A player can only participate once per cup. This is true for 1on1 and for team cups. Therefore a user cannot be in two teams that both participate in the same cup.
- Cup teams and cup matches differ from regular teams and matches
- The cup module is 100% independent of other modules (it depends on other modules but no other module depends on the cup module). Therefore you can deactivate it - if you want to - without affecting any other modules.
- Refugees do not have additional rights, this is just an information and has no functional effect
- Only Super-admins have additional rights
- When creating the seed (the matches of the first round), the number of slots will be reduced to the minimum (not less than the number of participants, of course). This is necessary due to the way wildcard-matches are generated.
- You have to start the seeding manually. This is by purpose so you will have time to check the participants before actually starting the cup. To initiate the seeding, go to the admin backend, go to the cup overview and click on the third of the four buttons in the action row of the cup.
- The cup will start automatically at the start time.
- Between the official start of the cup and the revealing of the bracket, admins will have two minutes to correct the seeding. During this time span, the matches and the bracket are only visible for them.
- Sometimes both participants of a match will accidentally confirm an invalid result. Sometimes participants will leave the cup after they have lost a match without confirming the result. These things happen - maybe not very often, but they do. Therefore we strongly recommend that every cup is accompanied by at least one refugee (who should be an admin). The task of the refugee is to confirm results if one participant of a match does not and to correct the winner of a match if the wrong participant was recorded as the winner.
- After the last match has been completed, the cup will be closed automatically. The winner of the cup (user or team) will receive "cup points" for winning a cup. You can change the number of points in the admin backend in the cups settings.
- You can see all the cup teams in the frontend with this URL: example.org/cups/teams/overview
- We recommend that before you run your first serious cup, you run a test cup to familiarise with the procedures.

**NOTE:**
Only super admins have admin rights on the frontend pages of the cups module (this may be changed in the future).
